# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project 🖼️🤖

**<U>CFAIR</U>** :- ***Canadian Institute For Advanced Research.***

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 object categories. The goal is to explore and optimize various models for better image recognition accuracy. 🏆

## 🔍 Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is widely used for training machine learning models and benchmarking image classification algorithms.

This repo focuses on:

- Data preprocessing 🧑‍💻
- Building and training CNN models 💻
- Evaluating model performance 📊
- Optimizing accuracy ⚡

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras**🌐
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation 📊
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization 📈
- **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation 📉

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subhasish20/CIFAR-Image-Classification.git
